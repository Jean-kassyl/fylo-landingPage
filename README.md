## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned
I've learned a lot by doing this project. Some of the things I have learned
are about: 
- how to position a background image
- how to use Grid 
- working with images in general

### Continued development

I have tried my best to make the project looks a little bit like the original but I think there is still things I would need to change. I still need to continue learning about some background properties like ` background-size` and `background-position`.
I also need to continue working with flexbox and grid and more importantly get confortable using images in general.
